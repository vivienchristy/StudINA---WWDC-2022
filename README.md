#StudINA 
HiðŸ‘‹! I am Vivien Christy Apriyanti from Batam, Indonesia. I am a Information Systems student who started learning iOS App Development at Apple Developer Academy @Infinite Learning Batam.

##About This App
Indonesia is a country with various ethnicities and cultures. Ethnic groups in Indonesia are often associated with their own distinctive form ofÂ Rumah Adat. Rumah Adat (rumah is house, and adat is tradition. Rumah adat is traditional house) is one of Indonesia's cultural heritage.

Unfortunately, Indonesiaâ€™s Rumah are threatened with extinction due to economic, technological, and social changes. Nowadays, many Indonesians are not familiar with Rumah Adat anymore, including me. 

As Indonesian, we should protect this cultural heritage. Therefore, I created this app to help Indonesians or other people who want to learn Rumah Adat of each provinces in Indonesia.  Letâ€™s learn together!
